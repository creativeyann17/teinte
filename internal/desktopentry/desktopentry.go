// Package desktopentry installs a "Teinte" launcher entry in the OS's
// application menu, pointing at the currently-running executable. It's
// called on every startup so the entry always reflects the latest
// install location — useful when the user moves or reinstalls the
// binary without uninstalling the previous entry.
//
// The public surface is a single Install(iconPNG) function. Each
// supported OS has its own build-tagged implementation file; anything
// not explicitly handled is a no-op (Windows wants an installer, macOS
// wants a .app bundle).

// as soon as dev exits. Production builds drop the `-dev-` infix and
// live at a stable path, which is the only case we want to register.
